### Tools of Cell Biology - Microscope
>Contemporary light microscopes: **1000x**
>Most cells are between **1–100 µm**

>Eyes Resolution: **0.2mm**

>The limit of resolution of the light microscope is approximately **0.2 µm**

**Resolution**: the ability to distinguish objects separated by small distances; is even more important than magnification.
:::
:::success
**Numerical Aperture (NA)**: the light-gathering *power* of the lens

:::
:::info
$Resolution=\dfrac{0.61\lambda}{NA}$

$NA =\eta \cdot sin(\alpha)$
η = refractive index of the medium
λ is fixed at approximately 0.5 mm

### Types of light microscopy

:::info
**Bright-field microscopy**: light passes directly through the cell. Cells are often preserved with fixatives and stained with dyes to enhance the contrast.
:::
>Whole mount biological sample
:::info
**Phase-contrast microscopy** and **Differential interference-contrast microscopy (DIC or Normarski)** both convert variations in density or thickness to differences in contrast that can be seen in the final image
:::
**?phase**

:::danger
Use phase shift to shapen the image
:::

:::info
**Video-enhanced differential interferencecontrast microscopy** allows visualization of the movement of organelles along microtubules, cytoskeletal protein filaments with a diameter of only 0.025 µm
:::
:::info
**Fluorescence microscopy** – A fluorescent dye is used to label the molecule of interest in fixed or living cells.
:::
:::success
The green fluorescent protein (GFP) of jellyfish can be used to visualize proteins in living cells. GFP can be fused to any protein of interest using standard methods of recombinant DNA.

:::
>GFP is a powerful reagent for live cells fluorescent microscopy
>
>Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) is used to study **rate of protein movement** in living cells.
